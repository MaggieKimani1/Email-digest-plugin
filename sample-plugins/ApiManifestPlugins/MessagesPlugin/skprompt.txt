Read the first 10 emails in my inbox and classify them based on urgency. Emails from your manager should be marked as high importance.

Steps:
1. Access Email Inbox:
   - Open my email client and navigate to your inbox.

2. Retrieve Emails:
   - Set up a script or use email filtering options to retrieve the first 10 emails.

3. Email Classification:
   - For each email:
     - Check the sender's email address.
     - If the sender is your manager:
       - Mark the email as high importance. My manager's email address is `admin@m365x03432055.onmicrosoft.com`
     - Analyze the subject line and content to determine urgency:
       - Keywords like "urgent," "deadline," "important," etc., may indicate high priority.
     - Classify the email into one of the following categories:
       - High Importance
       - Medium Importance
       - Low Importance

4. Prioritization:
   - Sort the emails into separate folders or categories based on their urgency level:
     - High Importance: Emails from your manager and those marked urgent.
     - Medium Importance: Emails requiring attention but not immediate action.
     - Low Importance: Emails that can be addressed later or are not urgent.

5. Action Plan:
   - Determine the actions required for each category of emails:
     - High Importance: Respond or take necessary actions immediately.
     - Medium Importance: Schedule time to address these emails promptly.
     - Low Importance: Review and respond as time permits.

6. Follow-Up:
   - Regularly check and update the email classification and prioritization as new emails arrive.

Once done, generate a report in the following markdown format.
